# Ramp Creator

This plugin can be used to create skateboard ramps. Once installed, it can be accessed from the "Add" menu when in Object Mode. 
Alternatively, you can use the following keybind: `ctrl + shift + spacebar`

There are five properties that can be used to tweak the shape of the resuling ramp: 

- Platform Width (controls size of the platform on top of the ramp)
- Ramp Height
- Ramp Width
- Ramp Length (only affects the length of the ramp area, not the top platform)
- Max Incliation (controls the inclination of the ramp at its highest point)
